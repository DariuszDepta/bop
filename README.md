### What is BSC?

The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) is a strategic management tool that helps organizations translate their vision and strategy
into a set of performance measures across four key perspectives. Developed in the early 1990s by Robert Kaplan and David Norton,
the BSC aims to provide a more comprehensive view of organizational performance beyond traditional financial metrics.

The four perspectives of the Balanced Scorecard are:

- **Financial Perspective**
 
  This includes traditional financial measures, such as revenue growth, profit margins, and return on investment.
  It answers the question: _**How do we look to our shareholders?**_

- **Customer Perspective**
 
  This focuses on customer satisfaction, retention, and acquisition. Typical metrics include customer satisfaction scores,
  market share, and customer loyalty. It addresses the question: _**How do our customers view us?**_

- **Internal Process Perspective**
 
  This involves improving internal processes to drive value for customers and achieve financial goals.
  Metrics here might focus on process efficiency, quality, and innovation.
  This perspective asks: _**What must we excel at internally to satisfy customers and financial goals?**_

- **Learning and Growth Perspective**
 
  This looks at the organization’s ability to innovate and improve over time, emphasizing employee skills,
  training, and corporate culture. It addresses the question: _**How can we continue to improve and create value?**_

The Balanced Scorecard enables organizations to take a balanced approach to performance measurement,
combining both leading (predictive) and lagging (historical) indicators. This provides a holistic
view of the organization’s health, aligns day-to-day work with strategic objectives,
and facilitates better decision-making across all levels of the organization.

### Is it possible to use balanced scorecard in a very small company with fast-changing business environment?

Yes, using a balanced scorecard (BSC) in a small company with a fast-changing business environment is possible
and can be highly beneficial, though it may need to be adapted to suit the company's size and the dynamic nature
of its environment.

Here’s how and why it can work:

- **Strategic Clarity and Focus**

  In a small company, leaders often need to juggle multiple roles, which can make it challenging to focus on strategy.
  A balanced scorecard helps maintain a clear, consistent focus on strategic objectives across four key areas:
  **financial**, **customer**, **internal processes**, and **learning/growth**.
  This structure can prevent short-term decisions from overshadowing long-term goals.
   

- **Flexibility and Simplification**
  
  Traditional BSC frameworks can be complex, but small companies can simplify the scorecard.
  You might focus on fewer metrics within each of the four perspectives.
  For example, if customer acquisition is a top priority, the customer perspective could center on metrics
  like new customer growth and satisfaction, allowing for focused improvement without overwhelming resources.


- **Adaptability in a Fast-Changing Environment**
 
  In a dynamic business environment, goals and metrics may need frequent review and updates.
  A BSC can be made more flexible by setting shorter review cycles (e.g., monthly or quarterly) 
  and adjusting metrics as priorities change. This agile approach keeps the scorecard relevant
  and aligned with the latest business needs.


- **Improved Decision-Making**
 
  A BSC gives leaders structured data points, making it easier to see the impact of changes in the environment
  and adjust accordingly. This can be especially valuable in a fast-changing industry, where staying adaptable is crucial.

 
- **Encouraging a Balanced Perspective**
  
  Small businesses sometimes focus heavily on immediate revenue or customer demands, especially in turbulent markets.
  A BSC ensures balanced attention to all areas essential for sustainable growth, like employee development
  or internal process efficiency, which helps build resilience.

By customizing the BSC for simplicity and agility, even a small business in a fast-paced market can leverage its benefits.
This keeps the focus on what's most important and enables quick adjustments as conditions change.
